# react-todo-exploration

My personal exploration into isomorphic react / flux (via [alt](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt)) / es6.

Using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) as a build system, with hot reloading using [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader).

## Setup

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run start-dev
```
